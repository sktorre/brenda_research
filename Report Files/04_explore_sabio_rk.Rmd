I first tried looking for PDB IDs in the brenda data base. I found some literature (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165617301839) that suggests you should be able to query for PDB in Brenda, but after doing a lot of searching I have not been able to find a way.

Here is a screenshot of the literature:

What is this description? I thought it might be PDB IDs but that doesn't seem to be true. Other than that I found nothing resembling a PDB ID.

```{r}
description <- ex_ec[["1.1.1.1"]][["molecular"]][["engineering"]]

# Sabio-RK

I searched for EC Number 1.1.1.1 in the Sabio-RK database and found 768 entries.

[ECNumber:"1.1.1.1"](http://sabio.h-its.org/newSearch/index)

There were too many entries for me to download them all in one file so I had to download the data in batches. Now I will have to read in the 4 separate files and combine them.

```{r}
sabio <- ""
file_names <- dir(path="./sabio_data")
for (i in file_names){
  file <- read_excel(paste0("./sabio_data/",i))
  sabio <- rbind(sabio, file)
}
sabio <- sabio[-1,]
```

Now we need to find the same information from Brenda for EC 1.1.1.1

```{r, warning = FALSE}

  #cleans up a column that is a list of values so each cell has its own row
  
  #splitting up the values of the column

  return(out_table)
}

parameters <- c("km.value", "turnover.number", "ki.value", "temperature.range", 
                "temperature.optimum", "ph.range", "ph.optimum")

brenda <- brenda_EC_data(brenda_data, "1.1.1.1", parameters)
```

The sabio-rk data for EC 1.1.1.1 has 769 rows versus the brenda data which has 1,985 rows. There is definitely more kinetics data in brenda than sabio-rk, but brenda is missing a lot of UNIPROTKBs. I want to check how many unique UNIPROTKB there are in each data set. 

Sabio-rk has some rows with multiple UNIPROTKB values in the same row so I need to clean this up.

```{r}
sabio <- cSplit(sabio, splitCols = "UniProtKB_AC" , sep = ";", direction = "wide", drop = FALSE)

sabio <- sabio %>% pivot_longer(cols = c(UniProtKB_AC_1,UniProtKB_AC_2), 
                                    names_to = "name", 
                                    values_to = "uniprot",
                                    values_drop_na = TRUE)
sabio$uniprot <- as.character(sabio$uniprot)
```

Now I can use the new `uniprot` column I created to see how many unique values are in each data set. 

```{r}
b_uni <- n_distinct(brenda$uniprot)

s_uni <- n_distinct(sabio$uniprot)
```

There are `r b_uni` unique UNIPROTKB values in the brenda db and `r s_uni` unique UNIPROTKB values in the sabio-rk db. With there being no difference in number of UNIPROTKB values, lets see if most of the UNIPROTKB values are the same between the two datasets.  

```{r}
b <- data.frame(uniprot = unique(brenda$uniprot))

s <- data.frame(uniprot = unique(sabio$uniprot))

dif <- anti_join(s, b, by = "uniprot")
```

There are quite a few differences between the UNIPROTKB values within the two datasets. I want to see if the data share the same PubMed ID for any instances. To do this I need to grab the PubMed ID from brenda and join it with the brenda data set for EC 1.1.1.1. 

```{r}
pubmed <- ex_ec[["1.1.1.1"]][["bibliography"]][["reference"]]

brenda$ref_id <- as.character(brenda$ref_id)

brenda <- left_join(brenda, pubmed, by = c("ref_id" = "refID"))
```

Now we can look at PubMed IDs between the two data sets.

```{r}
b_pubmed <- n_distinct(brenda$pubmed)

s_pubmed <- n_distinct(sabio$PubMedID)
```

There are `r b_pubmed` unique PubMed IDs in the brenda db and `r s_pubmed` unique PubMed IDs in the sabio-rk data set. Now let's check to see if any of these PubMed IDs are the same between the two data sets.

```{r}
b_pubmed_df <- data.frame(pubmed = unique(brenda$pubmed))

s_pubmed_df <- data.frame(pubmed = unique(sabio$PubMedID))

dif_pubmed <- anti_join(s_pubmed_df, b_pubmed_df, by = "pubmed")
```

There seem to be quite a few differences in PubMed IDs. Let's look at one in particular that is in both data sets as an example and see if the data looks similar between the two.

To look at parameter values in sabio-rk we need to clean up the `parameter.type` and `parameter.startValue` variables to have each parameter type in its own variable.

```{r}
sabio <- pivot_wider(sabio, names_from = parameter.type, values_from = parameter.startValue)
```

Now we can look at parameter values between the two data sets for the same PubMed ID.

```{r}
sim_pubmeds <- unique(inner_join(brenda, sabio, by = c("pubmed" = "PubMedID")) %>% select(pubmed))

ex_pubmed <- sim_pubmeds[[1,1]]

b_ex <- brenda %>% filter(pubmed == ex_pubmed) %>% 
  select(pubmed, organism, uniprot, km_value_commentary,km_value, turnover_number, ki_value) %>% unique()

s_ex <- sabio %>% filter(PubMedID == ex_pubmed) %>% 
  select(PubMedID, Organism, uniprot, Temperature, pH,kcat, Ki, Km) %>% unique()
```

```{r}
b_ex
s_ex
```

For PubMed ID `r ex_pubmed`, the organism, temperature and pH values look the same between both datasets. Further, none of these values in the brenda db have UNIPROTKB values but they all have UNIPROTKB values in the sabio-rk data. This means we could use the sabio-rk data to gather more UNIPROTKB values to add to the brenda data to make it more complete, but not many of the km, ki and kcat values are the same between the two data sets. It was hard to compare (I was doing it by eye), but I only found a couple matching values for this PubMed ID.

Another issue is finding a unique way to join the data from these two databases. As you can see there were a lot of duplicate values and no unique ID tying the two databases together. This is just one example of one PubMed ID and even in this example it was a bit messy for me to compare the two. I think the next step if we want to go down this route is to figure out if there is an easy way to combined these two data sources. There are other variables in sabio-rk that could help such as substrate, but I have not yet looked into any other variables than the ones shown here.
