This is the code to install the brendaDb package in R.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("brendaDb", dependencies=TRUE)
```

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
#libraries
library(brendaDb)
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#downloading the database and reading it into R
brenda.filepath <- DownloadBrenda()
brenda <- ReadBrenda(brenda.filepath)

#writing the db to a text file
fwrite(brenda,file = "brenda.txt")

#reading in the db as a data.table
brenda_data <- fread("brenda.txt")
```

I wrote the database into a file and read that back in as a data.table because it will be much quicker in the future than having to read in the database everytime we want to use it using ReadBrenda().

The database is not a similar structure to how the website is laid out so it isn't intuitive how to query for the data we care about. For example, there doesn't seem to be a way to grab just the data in the Functional Parameters section of the website. 

Here is an example query of how to extract meaningful data from the database. This example pulls out the information for the organism "Acetobacter pasteurianus" from the EC number 1.1.1.1. I included this example to show how we can relate the database to the actual information on the website we are looking to extract. 

```{r}
example <- QueryBrenda(brenda_data, EC = "1.1.1.1", organisms = "Acetobacter pasteurianus")
ace <- example[["1.1.1.1"]][["parameters"]][["km.value"]]

ace %>% filter(fieldInfo == "acetaldehyde")
```
<img src="./acetaldehyde_ex.png" />

You can see these results have the same KM Value ('description') and Commentary as we see in the table on the website and here 'fieldInfo' is the Substrate. 

I have not yet been able to determine if this is one-to-one mapping from the table on the website as I found some results I do not see on the website, but this is probably fine since we are just using the website as reference. 

Of course we want results for each enzyme across all organisms, but the organisms are stored in a separate table in the database.

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
test <- QueryBrenda(brenda_data, EC = "1.1.1.1")
t_km <- test[["1.1.1.1"]][["parameters"]][["km.value"]]

organisms <- test[["1.1.1.1"]][["organism"]][["organism"]]

head(organisms)
```

It looks like there is a 'refID' that is common between these tables so we might have to join on this value. In the organisms table the variable represents a list of reference IDs so we would have to do some cleaning first.
